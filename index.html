        <h3>Amaterasu</h3>
        <p>Amaterasu produces black flames at the focal point of my vision.In most situations, this makes Amaterasu impossible to avoid. It requires techniques of extreme speed allow the avoidance or interception of the jutsu after it has been cast.Said to be "the fires from hell" and to burn as hot as the sun itself.</p>

        <h3>Susanoo</h3>
        <p>My Susanoo is red and can be said as the strongest even without Hagoromo's chakra. My Susanoo is completed with a Totsuka Sword that can seal anything stabbed by it; and the Yata Mirror, that can reverse all kinds of attacks. Both weapons makes my Susanoo close to unbeatable.</p>

        <h3>Tsukuyomi</h3>
        <p>It allows me to cast a powerful illusion on others and trap them in a world where i controls everything. In the real world the opponent is only trapped for 1 secound but in the illusion for hours.</p>
